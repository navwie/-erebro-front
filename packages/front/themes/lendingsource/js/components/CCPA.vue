                    deletion immediately by contractual and statutory prohibitions set forth in the Telephone Consumer

                </p>

                <p class="mb-1"><b>OPT-OUT OF THE SALE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b></p>
                <p class="mb-4">Consumers have the right to opt-out of any sale of their personal information by a
                    business. If a consumer is initially requesting a product or service, such as on this site, this is
                    an exemption from this right, and we will process your request. However, thereafter, consumers have
                    the right to cease all further sharing of information.</p>

                <p class="mb-1"><b>NON-DISCRIMINATION.</b></p>
                <p class="mb-4">Consumers have a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by this site for the
                    exercise of these privacy rights conferred by the CCPA. This site will not deny you services and if
                    applicable, will not charge you different price points or rates for services or provide you a
                    different quality of service. However, if you exercise your statutory rights under CCPA to opt-out
                    of the sharing or selling of your information pursuant to the practices herein, this site will not
                    be able to provide you its services, such as passing your information to third-party Lenders or
                    financial service providers who may secure you a short-term loan or other financial products. This
                    is because you are requesting to opt-out of sharing of your Personal Information and not due to
                    discriminatory reasons.</p>

                <p class="mb-1"><b>LIMITATIONS.</b></p>
                <p class="mb-4">Consumers may only submit a CCPA request to be verified by this site twice within a
                    twelve month period. The verifiable consumer request must: (a) provide sufficient information that
                    enables this site to reasonably verify you are the individual about whom site collected Personal
                    Information; (b) describe the request with adequate detail that allows this site to properly
                    understand, evaluate, and respond to you, specifically whether you are requesting to know,
                    requesting not to sell, or requesting to delete. Unfortunately, for security and privacy reasons,
                    this site cannot respond to your CCPA request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot
                    verify your identity or confirm the Personal Information relates to you; The Personal Information
                    you provide in a CCPA request to be verified will only be used to verify the requestor’s identity or
                    authority.</p>

                <p class="mb-1"><b>RESPONSE TIME.</b></p>
                <p class="mb-4">This site reasonably endeavors to respond and process verified consumer request within
                    the statutory proscribed time of forty-five (45) days of its receipt. Should our site require more
                    time to process your request, we will provide you written notice and further information about the
                    disposition and extension. This notice will be provided by electronic mail to the contact you
                    provide. Further, any disclosures this site provides will only cover the twelve (12) month period
                    preceding a verifiable consumer request’s receipt by the site.</p>

                    time and for any reason and when modifications are implemented, they will take into effect
                    immediately upon publication and shall replace and supersede any previous policy. Your continued use
